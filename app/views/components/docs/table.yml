accessibility_criteria: |
  Accessible tables need HTML markup that indicates header cells and data cells and defines their relationship. Assistive technologies use this information to provide context to users.
  Header cells must be marked up with `<th>`, and data cells with `<td>` to make tables accessible.
  For more complex tables, explicit associations is needed using scope attributes.
