Hello,

The following piece of mainstream GOV.UK content is ready to be checked for factual accuracy:

Title: <%= @edition.title %>
<%= "#{Plek.current.find("publication-preview")}/#{@edition.slug}?edition=#{@edition.version_number}" %>

You will need your GOV.UK user name and password to preview the content.

If you or your colleagues spot something that's factually incorrect please reply to this email with comments (and where there are no inaccuracies, please reply indicating so):

- directing us to any specific instances, e.g. part 2, subheading 3
- explaining what the problem is, e.g. the text implies a legal obligation, when there isn't one

Please don't rewrite the text - only point out any factual errors.  We will rewrite accordingly.

Please also ensure that your comments are in plain text and sent in the body of the reply email.

Attachments are not supported and will not be logged in our system - therefore no attachments please.

Please respond within five working days.  If you may not be able to meet this deadline let us know as soon as possible.

PLEASE SEND COMMENTS TO THIS EMAIL ADDRESS:
