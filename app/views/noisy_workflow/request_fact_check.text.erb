Hi,

We need you to check the factual accuracy of changes made to ‘<%= @edition.title%>’ before it’s published on GOV.UK.

The GOV.UK Content Team made the changes because

**Deadline: <%= working_days_after(Date.current, how_many: 5).to_s(:govuk_date) %> (5 working days from today - <%= Date.current.to_s(:govuk_date) %>)**

Preview the changes:
<%= preview_edition_path(@edition) %>

---------------------------------------------------

**What to do**

Reply and confirm the content is correct.

Or, if you spot something that's not correct, reply to this email and tell us:

- which paragraph or section isn’t right - for example chapter 2, under heading ‘How much it costs’
- what’s wrong and why - for example the text implies a legal obligation, when there isn't one

---------------------------------------------------

**How to do it**

When fact checking, please:

- only point out factual errors - don’t suggest wording (GDS is responsible for the style)
- use plain text - GDS systems don’t display text formatting, colours or attachments

To get the content published more quickly:

- only include comments about sections that GDS has changed
- only reply once - it’ll help if you co-ordinate your response before replying

---------------------------------------------------

**When to contact your GOV.UK lead**

Ask your GOV.UK lead if:

- you’ve spotted a new issue - they’ll raise a new request with GDS
- you’ve got any questions - they can ask GDS any queries via the Zendesk system
- you need an extension to the deadline

Thank you.
