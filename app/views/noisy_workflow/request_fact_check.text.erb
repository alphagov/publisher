Hello.

The following piece of mainstream GOV.UK content needs to be fact checked because

Title: <%= @edition.title %>
<%= "#{Plek.current.find("private-frontend")}/#{@edition.slug}?edition=#{@edition.version_number}" %>

You'll need your GOV.UK user name and password to view the content. Email factcheck-help@digital.cabinet-office.gov.uk if you've forgotten your username and password.

Please reply to this email and either:

- confirm that the content is correct
- provide clear specific details of what's incorrect, why and what changes should be made

Only include factual errors - we'll rewrite any content as needed.

You must make sure:

- you only send 1 reply
- your reply is in plain text (eg no colours, italics or highlighted text)
- you don't send any attachments

Please reply within 5 working days. Let us know as soon as possible if you're not able to meet this deadline.

Please don't reply to this email to ask questions or include the address in any email conversations. Email factcheck-help@digital.cabinet-office.gov.uk if you have any questions.

Many thanks,
