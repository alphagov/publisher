<p>If passengers can make journeys of 15 miles or less over some parts of a long-distance service, those parts of the route should be registered as separate local services.</p>

<p>Registration is not required for rail replacement services or for certain not-for-profit transport schemes, eg school buses owned and operated by local authorities.</p>

<p>If your bus service operates partly within Greater London, you will also need a London service permit for that part of the route with passenger stops in London.</p>

<p>Vehicles will be expected to comply with statutory requirements regarding exhaust emissions and all new vehicles should be fully accessible to people with disabilities.</p>

<p>You need to register in each traffic area where your service has stopping points. However, in practice, the traffic area office to which you sent your application will copy it to the others.</p>

<p>You must also send copies of your completed application form and supporting documents to every local authority or Passenger Transport Executive that covers the route of your journey. You can get a list of addresses from traffic area offices.</p>

<p>If your registration is accepted, you will receive a letter confirming this from the traffic area office.</p>

<p>Once your service has been registered, you must ensure that you either display or have on your vehicles:</p>

<ul>
<li>a fare table</li>

<li>a timetable including details of the days when the service is to run</li>
</ul>

<p>The service number and destination (or route) must be displayed prominently on the outside of each vehicle.</p>

<p>If you fail to operate your service as registered, the traffic commissioner will carry out an investigation which may result in:</p>

</ul>

<p>RDSAP is the government approved standardised system for doing an energy survey on an existing dwelling, eg for homes being sold or rented out. A full Standard Assessment Procedure (SAP) requires many data items that can't obtained through a visual inspection or that may take too long to collect. RDSAP is an industry agreed standard set of data items and a standard way of inferring the missing data.</p>

<p>SAP is the procedure for energy assessments of domestic premises. It is used to show that they comply with part L of the Building Regulations 2010. SAP is used for new build dwellings where detailed construction data is available for use in the energy assessment.</p>

<p>You will normally need a level three diploma and certificate in domestic energy assessment.&nbsp;Some accreditation schemes may accept evidence of relevant experience as an alternative to the diploma.&nbsp;This procedure is known as&nbsp;accreditation of prior experience and learning - it applies if you already use RDSAP and produce SAP reports and EPCs when a dwelling is sold or let.</p>

<p>From 1 April 2012 if you are an existing DEA and want to continue practising and maintain your accreditation, you will need to obtain a new top-up qualification.&nbsp;This is because a revised version of the EPC, which contains significant changes to its content and format, will be in use from that date</p>

<p>The training is likely to take about 8 hours. When you have completed the training, you will be required to take a short online assessment to demonstrate you have acquired the necessary additional knowledge and understanding.</p>

<p>The stand-alone qualification will be available until October 2012 at which point it will be incorporated into the standard training for DEAs. If you have not undertaken the additional training and passed the online assessment within this timescale, you will need to start again from scratch.&nbsp;</p>

<p>In order to become accredited, you'll have to:</p>

<ul>
<li>show you can carry out consistent and accurate energy assessments in an independent manner</li>

<li>show you are fit, proper and qualified to carry out energy assessments</li>

<li>meet the National Occupations Standards for DEAs</li>

<li>enter any EPCs or recommendation reports that you produce and the data which was used to produce them or any asset rating onto the&nbsp;national register&nbsp;operated by Landmark on behalf of DCLG</li>
</ul>

<p>You'll need to submit a fully completed and signed application form, a basic&nbsp;Criminal Records Bureau check&nbsp;and proof of qualification to your accreditation scheme.</p>

<p>When producing EPCs or inspection reports you must include a declaration detailing if you have a business or personal relationship with either the person who commissioned the certificate or on whose behalf it was commissioned or anyone with an interest with either of these people or in the building.</p>

<p>You must carry out energy assessments with reasonable care and skill.</p>

A house with a portion separated out as a workshop, office or surgery should be dealt with as a mixed use building.</p>

<p>In other cases you should treat the dwelling and the non-dwelling parts separately using the most appropriate methodology for each part. For example, where a building contains both flats and offices you should use SAP or RDSAP for the flats and Simplified Building Energy Model or Dynamic Simulation Modelling for the offices, provided that you are qualified to produce an assessment using those software packages.</p>

It uses a description of the building's geometry, construction, use, heating, ventilating, air-conditioning and lighting equipment. From this it calculates the monthly energy use and carbon dioxide emissions of the building.</p>

<p>DSM is a software tool that models energy inputs and outputs for different types of buildings over time. It is used where SBEM will not be sophisticated enough to provide an accurate assessment of a building's energy efficiency.</p>

<p>There are two routes to accreditation as a level three or four NDEA qualification either by holding the correct qualification or accreditation of prior experiential learning (APEL). If you have experience in the commercial sector you must be able to show how you meet National Occupational Standards (NOS) when applying for accreditation.</p>

<p>You can only obtain level five accreditation through APEL. If you already use DSM software you must be able to show how you meet NOS, you must produce sample EPCs and undertake top-up training as necessary. You may also be required to hold a professional qualification.</p>

<p>You must register with a scheme that provides accreditation for NDEAs.</p>

<p>In order to become accredited, you will have to:</p>

<ul>
<li>show that you can carry out consistent and accurate energy assessments in an independent manner</li>

<li>show that you are a fit, proper person who is qualified (by education, training and experience) to carry out energy assessments</li>

<li>prepare EPCs and recommendation reports using standard forms</li>

<li>follow your scheme's code of conduct</li>

<li>enter any EPC or recommendation report that you produce and the data which was used to produce the document or calculate any asset rating onto the relevant register kept by the DCLG or an organisation/person keeping a register on DCLG's behalf</li>
</ul>

<p>As an energy assessor you may only conduct inspections in areas covered by your current qualification and accreditation system, ie if you are qualified and accredited to carry out domestic energy assessments you must not carry out non-domestic energy assessments unless also qualified and accredited for this area.</p>

<p>When producing EPCs or inspection reports you must include a declaration detailing whether you have a business or personal relationship with either the person who commissioned the certificate, any on whose behalf it was commissioned or anyone with an interest with either of these people or in the building.</p>

<p>You must carry out energy assessments with reasonable care and skill.</p>

<p>Mixed use buildings - when the building is built, sold or rented out - should be treated as a dwelling if the living accommodation is more than half of the total area of the building and the commercial part could revert to living accommodation without significant alteration. A house with a portion separated out as a workshop, office or surgery should be dealt with as a mixed use building.</p>

<p>In other cases you should treat the dwelling and the non-dwelling parts separately using the most appropriate methodology for each p","art. For example, where a building contains both flats and offices you should use Standard Assessment Procedure or Reduced Data Standard Assessment Procedure for the flats and SBEM or DSM for the offices.</p>

<p>In order to become accredited you must meet the relevant National Occupational Standards (NOS) in full. This includes showing full knowledge of operational rating methodology and the ability to use the approved operational rating software.</p>

<p>There are two routes to accreditation as an ORA. One is accreditation of prior experiential learning - if you already have experience of energy management or energy assessment you must show how you meet the NOS in full. You must include your experience of using operational rating software and may be required to produce example DECs and advisory reports. You may also need to take top-up training. You may also be required to hold a professional qualification.</p>

<p>The other route is by qualification by obtaining a level three diploma in display energy assessment.</p>

<p>In addition some schemes may require you to obtain a Criminal Records Bureau check if you are to carry out work in schools or care homes for example.</p>

<li>enter DECs and advisory reports produced by you onto the relevant register</li>
</ul>

<p>As an energy assessor you may only conduct inspections in areas covered by your current qualification and accreditation system, ie if you are qualified and accredited to carry out domestic energy assessments you must not carry out commercial energy assessment unless also qualified and accredited for this area.</p>

<p>When issuing a DEC, you must include a declaration of any personal or business relationship that you have with:</p>

<ul>
<li>the person who commissioned the certificate, or&nbsp;any person on whose behalf the certificate was commissioned - or&nbsp;any person who you believe&nbsp;may have a personal or business relationship with such a person</li>

<li>any person who you believe may have an interest in the building</li>
</ul>

<p>You must carry out energy assessments with reasonable care and skill. After assessing the building, you must also issue an advisory report containing recommendations for improvement of the energy performance of the building.</p>

<p>You must ensure that any DEC or advisory report that you issue, and the data which was used to calculate any operational rating, and to produce the document, is entered onto the relevant register kept by the DCLG before you give the document to the person who requested that it be issued.</p>

<p>There are two levels of ACL membership.</p>

<p>If you are over the age of 18 and have a minimum of four GCSEs at grade C (including maths and English) or above you can apply for student membership. If you don't meet the qualification requirements, you may need to sit an aptitude test.</p>

<p>Applications for membership are accepted once per year.</p>

<p>You can download an application form from the ACL website, and completed forms should be returned to the ACL.</p>

<p>All members must pay an annual subscription fee to the ACL. The level of fees will be determined by the class of membership that you hold.</p>

<p>The producer or holder must complete Parts A and B of the consignment notice. This must include:</p>

<ul class=""circlebullet"">
<li>the unique consignment number</li>

<li>a specific waste code for the type of hazardous waste</li>

<li>the producer's details</li>

<li>an accurate description of the waste</li>

<li>details of where the waste is going</li>

<li>a declaration that the waste management hierarchy has been applied - which means that all practical steps have been taken to reuse or recycle the waste before deciding to dispose of it</li>
</ul>

<p>A copy of Parts A and B must be sent to NIEA. It must be received at least 72 working hours before moving waste, unless the waste cannot stay where it is for 72 hours, or if it has previously been rejected by a receiver - you must consult NIEA in these cases.</p>

<p>The carrier must complete Part C and the consignor must complete Part D. The consignor and producer should then be given a copy each, and the carrier should be given the three remaining copies.</p>

<p>The consignor must ensure that any hazardous waste is properly packaged and labelled throughout the course of its collection, transport and temporary storage.</p>

<p>The carrier must ensure that all copies of the consignment notice travel with the waste and are given to the receiver upon delivery. The waste must ordinarily be delivered within a week.</p>

<p>The receiver must complete Part E on these copies and keep one, give a copy to the carrier for their records, and return a copy to NIEA. They also must provide returns or copies of completed consignment notices to the producers or holders of the waste.</p>

<p>If a receiver rejects the hazardous waste, they must complete Part E, retain a copy, return a copy to the carrier and return a copy to NIEA. If there are no consignment notices, they must provide NIEA with a written explanation of why.</p>

<p>The carrier must contact the NIEA and find alternative arrangements through the consignor.</p>

<p>If there is more than one carrier transporting the waste, the consignor must ensure that there are enough copies of the consignment notice for all parties including the additional carriers. The process is as above except each carrier must keep a copy of the notice for themselves and hand over the remaining copies to the next carrier.</p>

<p>You may not have to pre-notify NIEA if the movement is a subsequent repetitive movement - eg waste of the same description, from the same premises and consignor and being moved to the same premises and consignee. However, you will need to notify NIEA of the first movement in the succession. You will also need to follow the same procedures as above, without the notification to NIEA.</p>

<p>Anyone involved in the movement of waste must keep a register containing records of consignment notices, consignee returns and carrier schedules for at least three years. NIEA may request this information at any time.</p>

<p>Producers, holders, consignors, dealers and brokers of hazardous waste must also keep a record of the quantity, nature, origin, destination, frequency of collection, mode of transport and treatment method of the waste.</p>

<p>Additionally, if hazardous waste is deposited on any land, the location and identity of the waste must be recorded. This must be accompanied by a plan of the site locating the waste.</p>

<p>There are different movement requirements for removal of waste from a ship or through a pipeline, but you must still pre-notify NIEA.</p>

<p>For removing waste from a ship, the process is as outlined above, but the master of the ship must deal with the movement instead of a consignor.</p>

<p>You must supply RPID with the following details:</p>

<ul>
<li>your name and address</li>

<li>the address of the holding</li>

<li>the number of herds on the holding</li>
</ul>

<p>RPID will then provide you with a county parish holding (CPH) number. This is a unique code allocated to the land where the pigs are kept and must be used when reporting and recording animal movements.</p>

<p>You should not move pigs on or off your holding until you have been issued with a CPH number.</p>

<p>You must also notify your local Animal Health Veterinary Laboratory Agency (AHVLA) Divisional Office where you are going to keep pigs and they will give you a herdmark for your holding.</p>

<p>All pigs must be identified by an eartag or tattoo (either on the ear or a slapmark on the shoulder) containing your herdmark before they can leave the holding. Pigs less than 12 months old moving between farms can be identified by a temporary paint mark instead.</p>

<p>If you are moving pigs to a show or exhibition, to a semen collection centre, for breeding purposes, intra-Community trade or export or under a walking licence, they must also be identified with a unique individual identification number - eg by adding that number to the eartag.</p>

<p>Before you move a pig on or off your holding you must notify the movement to the Scottish livestock traceability team (ScotEID) by registering electronically on the ScotEID website or by calling or writing to the information centre.</p>

<p>Your notification must specify the:</p>

<ul>
<li>address (including postcode and CPH number) of the holdings from and to which the pigs are being moved</li>

<li>date of the movement</li>

<li>number of pigs moved</li>

<li>identification mark of each pig moved</li>

<li>lot number of pigs being moved, if they're being moved from a market</li>
</ul>

<p>This information should also be recorded in your own holding register within 48 hours of a movement on or off your holding. You should keep a separate register for each holding you use. Holding registers can take any form that you like but you must keep records for a minimum of three years and make them available for inspection on request. Once a year you must also record all the pigs in your holding.</p>

<p>Pig movements must be accompanied by a movement document. This can be printed off if you have registered on the ScotEID website or sent to you if you notified the movement by telephone. However, if you have chosen to notify ScotEID in writing, you must supply your own movement document.</p>

<p>When pigs arrive on your holding, this triggers a 'standstill' during which other livestock must not be moved off the holding for a set period of time. More details on this are available in guidance issued by the Scottish Government.</p>

<p>RPID carry out pig inspections each year to ensure that identification and traceability rules are being complied with. If you fail to comply with any of these rules, RPID inspectors may take enforcement action. This ranges from the issuing of guidance on how to take steps, to prosecuting you for committing a criminal offence. Movement restrictions may also be placed on your holding until problems are rectified.</p>

<p>The initial 50 licences are issued based on experience of active and material participation in the commercial Dee Estuary cockle fishery, in accordance with the Environment Agency's published licence allocation policy. Any additional licences will be issued to those on a waiting list. Licences will be allocated on a points system, based on historic track record of fishing activity.</p>

<p>Conditions may be attached to your licence, eg in relation to the cockle beds you can take cockles from, when you may do so or the size or description of dredges, fishing instruments or vessels you may use.</p>

<p>You must comply with the following restrictions regardless of the conditions attached to your licence:</p>

<ul>
<li>not to remove culch or other material used for the reception of spat (ie very young cockles) without written permission</li>

<li>not to fish for cockles from a closed bed unless you have been given written consent from the Environment Agency</li>

<li>not to introduce cockles into the estuary</li>
</ul>

<p>You must produce a copy of your licence on request by an Environment Agency officer. If you are unable to do so, you must not fish for or remove cockles until you have located a copy of the licence.</p>

<p>A second person may be authorised to fish for cockles if you apply for them to be added to your licence. An authorised person can't fish for cockles at the same time as the licence holder.</p>

<p>You should call the Environment Agency on Tel 03708 506 506 to find out more about obtaining a licence.</p>

<p>If you dredge, fish for or take cockles without a licence or other authorisation, or in breach of any condition of a licence, you may be fined up to &pound;5,000.</p>

<p>You do not require a licence to fish for cockles if you collect by hand no more than 5 kilograms per day for your own consumption.</p>
