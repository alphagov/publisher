# Simple Smart Answer

[Simple smart answers](https://docs.publishing.service.gov.uk/document-types/simple_smart_answer.html) work for complex situations with multiple variables and outcomes, where using this format will simplify the user journey.
A simple smart answer is a series of questions that channels a user to a certain outcome based on their responses. They use simple decision tree logic and don’t involve calculations.
They differ from standard [smart answers](https://github.com/alphagov/smart-answers), which generally require a developer to maintain.
