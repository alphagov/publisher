# Configuration for the fact check system
# This file is overwritten on deployment

# The main address pattern sent out as the From address on fact check emails
# If we ever want to change this format, we'll need to support some notion of
# legacy formats, so we still pick up emails to old addresses
address_format: "factcheck+dev-{id}@alphagov.co.uk"
