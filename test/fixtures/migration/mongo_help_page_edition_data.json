Find out more about the cookies we use, what they’re for and when they expire. \r\n\r\n##Cookies that measure website use\r\n\r\nWe use Google Analytics cookies and a Real User Monitoring (RUM) cookie from SpeedCurve to collect information about how you use GOV.UK.\r\n\r\nWe use the following Google Analytics cookies on GOV.UK:\r\n\r\nName | Purpose | Expires\r\n-|-|-\r\n_ga | These help us count how many people visit GOV.UK and other government digital services by tracking if you’ve visited before | 2 years\r\n_gid | These help us count how many people visit GOV.UK and other government digital services by tracking if you’ve visited before | 24 hours\r\n_ga_S5RQ7FTGVR | Used by Google Analytics to find and track an individual session with your device | 2 years\r\n\r\nYou can opt out of Google Analytics cookies on the [GOV.UK cookies page](/help/cookies) or by installing the [Google Analytics Opt-out Browser Add-on](https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout). \r\n\r\nYou can read Google’s overview of [data practices within Google Analytics](https://support.google.com/analytics/answer/6004245).\r\n\r\nOther government digital services also use Google Analytics cookies to collect information about how you use them and they share this information with us. Each digital service has its own consent mechanism and cookie policy that provides more information about their use of cookies.\r\n\r\nThe [GOV.UK Privacy Notice](/help/privacy-notice) has more information about the data we collect using Google Analytics cookies and information we receive from other digital services.\r\n\r\nWe also set our own cookie to understand how people move through the site:\r\n\r\nName | Purpose | Expires\r\n-|-|-\r\nanalytics_next_page_call | This lets us know the next page you visit on GOV.UK, so we can make journeys better | When you close your browser \r\n\r\nSpeedCurve RUM sets the following cookie:\r\n\r\nName | Purpose | Expires\r\n-|-|-\r\nlux_uid | This lets us understand the web performance you experience while on GOV.UK | 1 day or 30 minutes of inactivity \r\n\r\n###Comparing different versions of a webpage\r\n\r\nWe sometimes use analytics to try out different versions of pages to see which work better for users ('multivariate testing'). We'll save a cookie so that you consistently see the same version when browsing GOV.UK.\r\n\r\nThe cookie name will change but will be in the form 'ABTest-[Test name]' where the 'Test name' describes which part of GOV.UK is being tested. \r\n\r\nThis type of cookie will usually expire after between 1 and 4 weeks, but this may be longer for more in-depth tests.\r\n\r\nIf you have not opted in to this type of cookie, you'll see the standard version of the page being tested.\r\n\r\n###JavaScript detection\r\n\r\nWe measure how many people visiting GOV.UK are using JavaScript, so that the site works for as many users as possible.\r\n\r\nName | Purpose | Expires\r\n- | - | -\r\nJS-Detection | This tells us if you are browsing GOV.UK while running JavaScript | 1 year\r\n\r\n##Cookies that help with our communications and marketing\r\n\r\nSome GOV.UK pages may contain content from other sites, like YouTube or Flickr, which may set their own cookies. These sites are sometimes called ‘third party’ services. This tells us how many people are seeing the content and whether it’s useful.\r\n\r\nIn addition, if you share a link to a GOV.UK page, the service you share it on (for example, Facebook) may set a cookie. We have no control over cookies set on other websites - you can turn them off, but not through us.\r\n\r\n###YouTube videos\r\n\r\nWe use YouTube to show videos on some GOV.UK pages.
