    There are different ways to register if you’re:

    - [self-employed or a sole trader](/log-in-file-self-assessment-tax-return/register-if-youre-self-employed)
    - [not self-employed](/log-in-file-self-assessment-tax-return/register-if-youre-not-self-employed)
    - [registering a partner or partnership](/log-in-file-self-assessment-tax-return/register-if-youre-a-partner-or-partnership)

    Allow enough time to complete the registration process so you can send your return by the [deadline](/self-assessment-tax-returns/deadlines).

    ##If you've already registered

    Once you've registered, you'll get a letter that tells you what to do next. It will include your Unique Taxpayer Reference (UTR).
